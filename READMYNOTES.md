### Configuration Management tools

tools that put IAC into practice along with orchestration tools


Config Management tools include:
- Chef (ruby)

### Ansible - a high level language

(high level: python, java, etc --- low level: binary computing)

- Applicable in different terminal environment (powershell vs bash)
- Ansible is used for dealing with different package managers.
- Abstracting the most used commands and operations in provisioning so you can be more flexible.

[FLEXIBILITY | EASE OF USE | ROBUSTNESS | COST]

- Free
- Allows us to become infrastructure agnostic
- As it is a config management tool; increases robustness
- It is easy to use
